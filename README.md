# Dev Toolbox

This project is a collection of mini tools to aid software developers. More details on the capabilities and usage instructions will be added soon.

## Development server

The frontend code was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.1. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
